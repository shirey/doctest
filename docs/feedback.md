# User Feedback

Feedback about the portal comes through multiple channels, including:
- [the contact form](https://hubmapconsortium.org/contact-us/),
- the [feedback email](mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org) link in the footer,
- [directly in github](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues/new/choose),
- and periodic user surveys.

Tags are used to identify issues associated with different phases of the project:
- [Alpha](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAlpha)
- [Beta](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABeta)

## Process

- Feedback is first processed by the IEC, and user account and globus issues are handled there.
- If the problem concerns the Portal an issue is then filed in github with the
  [`triage`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atriage) tag.
- A Portal developer reviews it, and may
    - split it up into more fine-grained issues,
    - note existing issues that cover the same ground,
    - add notes to the issue clarifying the work to be done,
    - or move it to a diffent repo, for instance [`portal-docs`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-docs/issues).
- At this point either the `triage` tag is removed, and it is treated like any other internal issue,
  or it is [closed](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atriage+is%3Aclosed).
- Current work items are tracked with
  [milestones](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%2A+is%3Aopen).
- Tags are used to identify issues that are not moving forward. Possible reasons include:
    - Waiting to see if more people complain:
      [`on-hold`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aon-hold)
    - Prerequisites not in place:
      [`blocked`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ablocked)
    - Not feasible, or just not a good idea:
      [`wontfix`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awontfix)
