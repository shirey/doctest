# HuBMAP Portal Release - Summer 2020

The objectives of our inaugural portal release are to:
- enable rich, multi-modal, normal tissue dataset sharing with biomedical and data scientists
- engage the HuBMAP consortium and allied atlas-creating consortia to instrumentally advance biomedical data sharing
- get feedback from the user community for subsequent HuBMAP Portal releases

## Key Features

### Access
- Public access to imaging and non-identifiable sequencing dataset visualization
- Anonymous access to download non-identifiable sequencing & imaging datasets
- Authenticated access to potentially identifiable sequencing datasets via dbGaP 

### Search & View
- Sequencing, Microscopy & Mass Spectrometry imaging data
- Spatial common coordinate framework data for select Kidney and Spleen datasets
- Faceted search for select metadata fields
- Cell naming future functionality preview

### Analysis & Infrastructure
- Hybrid cloud storage and computing resource access
- Standardized pipeline application and derived data for CODEX, sc/snRNAseq, sc/snATACseq, and bulk sequencing (ATAC, RNA, WGS) datasets

## Future Releases
Our next portal release will focus on sharing of new modalities and enhancements for use of existing modalities.  We are targeting additional organ spatial data as well as integrated analyses focused on cell naming.

>To request a feature for a future Portal release, please contact [help@hubmapconsortium.org](mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org) and share your ideas.
