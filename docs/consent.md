|Institution|Access Type|Access Location|Data Use Limitations (DUL)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Caltech TMC|Controlled|dbGaP|GRU|
|Florida TMC|Controlled|dbGaP|GRU|
|Stanford TMC|Unrestricted|dbGaP first, HuBMAP Portal later|No Limitations|
|UCSD TMC|TBD|dbGaP|GRU|
|Vanderbilt TMC|TBD|BioProjects|GRU|

- The no restrictions data is accessible from the portal. 
- Once the data are available in dbGap the identifiers will be available from the portal. [See HuBMAP Policies](https://hubmapconsortium.org/policies/) 
- [Consent Codes: Upholding Standard Data Use Conditions](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005772)

### Additional Information: 
These are raw single cell RNA/ATAC-Seq data and WGS data. Not other types of data. These are in accordance with IRB restrictions, deidentified and accords with dbGap rules.
