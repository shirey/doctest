# Search SDK

## Search SDK Overview

The search sdk may be used to access any functionality from the Search API. In order to use the search sdk, the hubmap_sdk package will either need imported with 

```python
import hubmap_sdk
```

or the search sdk class maybe be directly imported with 

```python
from hubmap_sdk.searchsdk import SearchSdk
```

In order to use any of the search sdk methods, create an instance of the search sdk class. This class accepts 2 
arguments, both of which are optional. The first is "token". Token is a Globus Groups token. If there is no such token, 
only public accessible methods will be reachable. Methods that require special access will be indicated below. 

Depending on whether a token is given or, if one is given, which user groups the provided token belongs in, some or all functionality in certain methods will 
remain inaccessible. These too will be detailed in each method's outline below. Validation of Globus tokens is performed 
when the search api is called. If, for example, a method that requires a token is used but there is no token
given, the search api will return an error detailing the problem. This will also happen if a token is provided that is 
invalid, or if the token given is valid but is not part of the necessary user group to access part or all of a method.

If no token is given, it is assumed that there is no token. 

The next argument is service_url. The Search Api has several servers: Dev, Test, Stage, and Production. It is also 
possible to run the search api locally. service_url is where the chosen instance of Search Api is selected. If none is
provided, the production server will be used automatically. Be certain there are no typos in the service url. The urls 
for the different servers are as follows: 

* Dev: https://search-api.dev.hubmapconsortium.org/
* Test: https://search-api.test.hubmapconsortium.org/
* Stage: https://search-api.stage.hubmapconsortium.org/
* Production: https://search.api.hubmapconsortium.org/

If using a local instance of Search Api, by default the port used is 5005. Therefore "localhost:5005" would be used for
service_url. 

Once this search sdk instance is created, it will be used for each method. Creating a search sdk instance will look 
like the following:

```python
from hubmap_sdk import SearchSdk

#In this example, the token and service url are being retrieved from a configuration file.
url = app.config['DEV_URL']
token = app.config['GLOBUS_TOKEN'] 


search_instance = SearchSdk(token, url)
```

### Indices

<table>

<tr><td>Description</td><td>Indices will return a list of supported indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arguments</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Outputs</td><td>This method outputs a list of strings. Each string is a supported index</td></tr>
<tr><td>Error Handling</td><td>If the response code from Search Api is greater than 299, an exception will be raised. The exception message will be the response from the Search API. The indices method will return this response from the API, so if this exception is handled individually, this information can be used. If the request to the Search Api fails, an exception will be raise as well</td></tr>
<tr><td>Authorizations</td><td>This method requires no token</td></tr>

</table>

Example:

```python
list_of_indices = searchsdk_instance.indices()
```

### Status


<table>

<tr><td>Description</td><td>Get status will print and return the current build, elasticsearch connection, elasticsearch status, and version of the Search Api.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arguments</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Outputs</td><td>This method will print the version, build, and neo4j connection status to the terminal.

Additionally, the complete response from search api will be returned as a dictionary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Error Handling</td><td>Most methods will raise an exception if either Search Api returns an error code (http status code 300 or greater) or if the connection fails altogether. Because of the nature of the status method, if either of these occur, an exception will not be raised, rather the exception or error message from Search Api will be printed to the terminal and returned.</td></tr>

</table>

Example:

```python
status_object = statussdk_instance.get_status()
```

<tr><td>Error Handling</td><td colspan="2">If the response code from Search Api is greater than 299, an exception will be raised. The exception message will be the response from the Search API.

The reindex all method will return this response from the API, so if this exception is handled individually, this information can be used. If the request to the Search Api fails, an exception will be raise as well</td></tr>
